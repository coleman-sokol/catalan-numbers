# The Catalan Numbers
### About
[The Catalan Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number "Catalan Number - Wikipedia") are an infinite sequence of numbers found in various counting problems.

### How to Find Terms in the Series
Term number *n* is found through the following equation, where *!* denotes a factorial:
(2n)! / ((n+1)\*n!)

# About This Program
### What it Does
This program repeatedly takes a whole number input, and outputs that term of the Catalan Numbers. It also outputs approximately how much time, in seconds, it took to perform the computation.

### Notable Warning
**_ Due to the exponential nature of the Catalan Numbers, numbers will take longer and longer to compute, potentially exponentially. _**
**_ I have only used this program to compute Catalan term 1,000,000 and smaller. While computing term 1,000,000 on my 2015 MacBook Air, I let it run for about 25 minutes, then had to quit the program, as my computer began getting too warm. Later on, I computed term 400,000, which took 429.27 seconds, or about 7 minutes and 10 seconds. _**
**_ Therefore, PLEASE USE THIS PROGRAM RESPONSIBLY. Don't overload your device(s). _**
